# Mask-Detector
A Python based application that detects people with and without masks!
The project will be implemented using Python, with a focus on using computer vision and deep learning libraries such as OpenCV and TensorFlow.



# Features
* Face detection: The system will detect faces in real-time using computer vision algorithms.
* Mask classification: The system will classify whether a person is wearing a mask or not based on the face detected.
* Alert mechanism: The system will provide an alert when it detects a person without a mask.
* User-friendly interface: The system will have a user-friendly interface that displays the real-time results of face detection and mask classification.
